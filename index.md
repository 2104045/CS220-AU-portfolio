**Student in Univeristy of Essex**  

*Kamusta?* My name is Chrsitine Salaysay. I'm a first year student studying Psychology at the University of Essex. I'm currently employed with three part-time jobs. It can be tough at times, but it helped me shape the person I am now. I’m interested in travelling and meeting new people from different walks of life. It gives me purpose and a chance to explore whilst getting to know the world better. I also enjoy posting stuff on internet, specifically instagram. I consider it as my playground to release the creativity inside me.

## Work Experience
### Part-time jobs
#### Support Worker

September 2021 - present

Besides being a full-time student, I also hussle on the side. I support clients with learning disabilities. My key responsibilities are providing physical support (personal care and household tasks), emotional support (understanding their needs), encouraging personal growth through interest-driven activities, and partnering with other healthcare professionals. 

#### Elderly Care

October 2020 - present 

Similar to being a support worker, I accommodate two elder people with care companionship, making sure their day-to-day needs are met, such as assisting them in the kitchen whilst they cook, providing personal care (e.g., oral care), and household chores.

#### Cleaning 

October 2020 - present

I am responsible for maintaining a clean and organised home. Through this, I attained good time-management skills, ability to work autonomously, consistency and attentiveness. 

#### Team Member in a Restaurant

June 2019 - August 2019

I provide customer service, as well as taking phone calls from customers.

## My interests
# Baking :woman_cook::brown_heart:

I took interest in baking when I once craved for a soft and dewy cookie, but couldn't find it elsewhere. Hence, taking the matter in my own hands and started experimenting with the ingredients I had at home and violà! I have my own version of chewy chocolate chip cookies!

I decided to give them away to my close friends as Christmas treats and added a personal touch by printing my face and making a logo with it. I also DIYed those box and they ended up loving it as much as I do!

It started as a simple craving, now I'm planning to start a home-baking business!

# Travelling :heart_on_fire:

This particular building is what welcomes me every time I travel to London from Colchester. It gives me everything-seems-possible moment as I walk out of the Liverpool Street station.


> :round_pushpin: The Queen's Walk, London

The first spot I visited when I got in the UK for the first time in my entire life. I was 17 then. This wondrous city sparked a magic in me and is still evident in my face as you can see. I think the heavenly pink skies and illuminating city lights supported my argument.

> :round_pushpin: Covent Garden, London

I was walking around London and took this whilst waiting for my best friend to come around from her work. This might look a simple portrait to some, but sometimes I find myself taking things for granted. I'm literally walking in the miracle I prayed for. I have nothing but gratitude, hence a photo of a random building in London to show my appreciation and remind myself of where I am in this lifetime.
