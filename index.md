**Student in Univeristy of Essex**  

*Kamusta?* My name is Chrsitine Salaysay. I'm a first year student studying Psychology at the University of Essex. I'm currently employed with three part-time jobs. It can be tough at times, but it helped me shape the person I am now. I’m interested in travelling and meeting new people from different walks of life. It gives me purpose and a chance to explore whilst getting to know the world better. I also enjoy posting stuff on internet, specifically instagram. I consider it as my playground to release the creativity inside me.

## Work Experience
### Part-time jobs
#### Support Worker

September 2021 - present

Besides being a full-time student, I also hussle on the side. I support clients with learning disabilities. My key responsibilities are providing physical support (personal care and household tasks), emotional support (understanding their needs), encouraging personal growth through interest-driven activities, and partnering with other healthcare professionals. 

#### Elderly Care

October 2020 - present 

Similar to being a support worker, I accommodate two elder people with care companionship, making sure their day-to-day needs are met, such as assisting them in the kitchen whilst they cook, providing personal care (e.g., oral care), and household chores.

#### Cleaning 

October 2020 - present

I am responsible for maintaining a clean and organised home. Through this, I attained good time-management skills, ability to work autonomously, consistency and attentiveness. 

#### Team Member in a Restaurant

June 2019 - August 2019

I provide customer service, as well as taking phone calls from customers.
