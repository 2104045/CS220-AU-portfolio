## Reflection on digital identities

An individual’s digital identity is a collection of information about them that exists online, such as their public domain, e.g., social media posts, articles, affiliations with organisations, interactions and more. How we present ourselves to others and the way others perceive us define our digital identities, both personally and professionally. Understanding our digital identity sheds a light on who we are in real life through online. As a result, we often make assumptions about people based on the representation we created despite having never met them in person. 

To help identify and improve my digital identities, I explored White et al.’s Visitor and Resident (V&R)  concept which proposed two modes that describes individual’s activity with the Web in the simplest way. This is further defined depending on whether we engage in a personal or institutional (professional) approach. The Visitor mode refers to activities that leave no social or other traces behind. For example, browsing the Web for information, watching videos, paying bills and shopping. Although, search engines could store search history and websites can track us even if we are not logged in. On the other hand, Resident mode is when we interact with other people and leave a social trace. One that remains after we leave the internet, e.g., writing a blog or commenting on someone else’s content on social networks. Since these forms of presence are public, they can be associated with our digital identities. Therefore, we should be cautious when we use both Visitor and Resident modes. In terms of personal engagement, an example is contacting friends and family via media and email, whilst a view of an institutional engagement activity is to share or discuss concept online (or in print) as a worker or a student in higher education. 
Using the V&R map , I identified the following ways I engage with the Web in my visitor and resident modes (see photo below).

To clarify, in my visiting mode, the prime activities are searching (safari), online shopping (Zara, Bershka, Amazon), Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok and Uni Portal. In my resident mode, the primary activities are Twitter, Instagram and PeoplePlanner.

The difference between my personal and institutional modes is the type of audience I reach online. My personal mode consists of peers and other familiar names (friends and family). My personal impact could affect their action in a positive or negative way. On the other hand, my institutional mode creates an effect (could also be positive or negative) within the professional activities of an individual or society. For instance, I visualise putting up a home-based business on my Instagram account since entrepreneurial activities and processes are being transformed by digital technologies. Consequently, the probability of engaging with professionals or businessmen would be higher than staying inside my box which I refer to as my personal mode. 

I aim to improve my current digital identity by enhancing my current personal mode into institutional and build up its purpose. In this matter, it gives me a range of new ways I can potentially engage my peers, nearby users online or even worldwide. For example, making a gradual difference such as casually viewing a vlog on YouTube, then transitioning to making my own creative work and finally moving from personal/visitor mode to professional/resident mode. Furthermore, promoting educational material and inspiration insights through a website that could potentially reach an unimaginable number of audiences online is one of the many positive influences of Web. This allows us to establish our own work without the institutional gatekeepers and most of the time, they do not require a big-budget. In contrast, prior to Web, only experts were able to publish institutionally reviewed materials on paper as this was expensive.  

As part of my digital identity development, I have critically examined my current use of digital identities that could hinder my personal or professional aims. My friends and I have discussed this matter and our discourse centered on “to use the Web more efficiently”. If we were smarter about using digital technologies instead of being controlled by them, they could be such wonderful instruments of liberation. The main point is to know our limit and not overdo it. We must find the balance with the time we have when using the Web and having enough self-discipline to know if our usage is causing more damage, e.g., extensive use of internet or addiction to online gaming, rather than being beneficial, e.g., educational research, learning a new skill or get a taste of new perspectives and worldviews by subscribing to interesting YouTube channels or watching interesting talks on social media.

The V&R map has helped me review my current online presence and map out a plan of action which will help me improve my digital identity. I found this article called ‘10 Steps For Improving Your Digital Identity’  that discusses the key steps to make one’s digital identity better. To sum up, people have the ability to connect with others through making a slight difference that would eventually make a significance change overtime. I plan to add a personal touch to my content as this will set my work apart from the competition and strengthen my connections through interacting with individuals when suitable. I will set aside an hour every week to work on this objective. 

See below my future digital identity:

By the end of this, I desire to make an institutional impact where I promote my own work on the platform that used to be my visiting mode, e.g., Twitter and TikTok, and inspire people who will eventually create their own business or spread positivity that outweighs the negativity on every social media platform. Finally, creating a blog solely for my home-based business to further expand my potential and share it to the world.
