## Overview

As part of the 'Navigating the Digital World' assignment, I created this GitHub repository.

A link in the sidebar will take you to the one-pager website, which is the 'index.md.' file. I have included my personal and professional CV, where you can learn more about who I am personally nad professionally. 

A PDF of my essay will be uploaded to faser.
